## Known Issues

### Quest: Smooth Locomotion/Turning Not Working

**Status**: Input is working, code is executing, but no visual movement

**Evidence**:
- Joystick input is successfully read (confirmed via logs showing x/y values)
- `processLocomotion()` function is being called
- `updatePlaySpaceOffset()` completes without errors
- Position offset values are being calculated and updated
- BUT: Player position/rotation does not change visually

**Investigation Results**:
- Input layer (`getActionVector2`) works correctly
- Action bindings are correct (move_action, turn_action)
- OpenXR calls succeed (no error returns)
- Reference space is STAGE type
- Layer projection space is updated after offset change

**Suspected Cause**:
Quest/Android may have platform-specific behavior with dynamic reference space recreation. The `xrDestroySpace` + `xrCreateReferenceSpace` pattern works on PC VR but may not take effect properly on Quest, possibly due to:
- Reference space caching
- Frame timing issues
- Platform-specific OpenXR implementation differences
- STAGE space limitations on Quest

**Next Steps**:
1. Try switching from STAGE to LOCAL reference space type
2. Add more detailed logging to confirm offset values are changing
3. Test if locomotion works after a frame delay
4. Investigate Quest-specific OpenXR reference space documentation
5. Consider alternative locomotion approaches (e.g., manual matrix transforms)

|---------|---------|---------|
| hello_vr | ✅ | ✅ |
| hello_smooth_turning | ✅ | ❌ (input works, locomotion doesn't) |
